# AI/Spec-Driven Unified Book Creation Constitution

## Vision
To design, write, and deploy a complete, production-quality technical book using AI-native software development practices, powered by Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code, and published through Docusaurus on GitHub Pages.

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through Direct Verification
All factual and technical claims must be verifiable through credible sources. All content must be grounded in primary and trusted technical sources, with accuracy verified through direct validation rather than assumptions.

### II. Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be clear and accessible for a technical audience (students, developers, and AI engineers). All explanations must be beginner-friendly while remaining technically correct, targeting intermediate technical level readability.

### III. AI-Native Development with Human-in-the-Loop Validation
AI tools (Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus) must be used as co-authors, not replacements for human judgment. All AI-generated content must be reviewed, edited, and validated by humans, with safety, privacy, and responsible AI principles respected at all stages.

### IV. Reproducibility and Transparency
All content, structure, and workflow must be reproducible. The generation process must be transparent with sources, tools, and methods clearly documented. Version control must be maintained via GitHub with clean repository practices.

### V. Technical Excellence
All code examples must be runnable, minimal, and clearly explained. The book must build successfully with zero build errors using Docusaurus. All content must be written in Markdown and follow consistent documentation structure defined by Spec-Kit Plus.

### VI. Ethical Content Creation
No hallucinated concepts, tools, or references are allowed. Plagiarism tolerance is 0%. All reused ideas must be rewritten originally with proper attribution. Minimum 60% of sources must come from official documentation, research papers, or authoritative technical platforms.

## Success Criteria
- Fully deployed live book on GitHub Pages
- All chapters pass human factual verification
- Zero plagiarism detected
- Clean GitHub repository with documented workflow
- Clear demonstration of AI-native software development using Spec-driven processes
- Judges can reproduce the book-generation process using the provided specs
- The book builds successfully
- The deployed site is publicly accessible
- The content reflects real understanding, not just AI output
- The project clearly demonstrates the power of Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code working together

## Constraints
- Book length must be determined by topic depth, with no artificial padding
- Chapters must be modular and independently readable
- No copyrighted material may be copied directly
- All diagrams must be either original or properly attributed
- All content must follow consistent documentation structure defined by Spec-Kit Plus
- Platform must be Docusaurus with GitHub Pages deployment
- Tooling must include Spec-Kit Plus for specification-driven structure and Claude Code for AI-assisted content generation

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Technical audience (students, developers, and AI engineers)
- Secondary: Judges and evaluators of the book-generation process
- Tertiary: Open source community and AI development practitioners

## Brand Voice
Professional, educational, and practical. The tone should be clear, precise, and structured while remaining approachable for technical readers. Explanations should be patient and supportive, with concepts clearly explained and properly attributed.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation and development decisions for the AI/Spec-Driven Unified Book Creation project. All contributions must align with these principles, and any significant departures require explicit approval and documentation of rationale. Content reviews must verify compliance with accuracy, ethical standards, and technical quality requirements.
