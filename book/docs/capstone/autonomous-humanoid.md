# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Humanoid Robot project integrates all modules into a complete system capable of understanding voice commands and executing them in the physical world. This capstone project demonstrates the full pipeline from perception to action.

## System Architecture

```
Voice Command → LLM Processing → Vision Context → Action Planning → Robot Execution
```

The system architecture includes:
1. **Module 1**: ROS 2 communication framework
2. **Module 2**: Digital twin simulation environment
3. **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac AI perception and reasoning
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action integration

## Key Capabilities

- Voice command understanding and processing
- Real-time visual perception and context awareness
- AI-powered reasoning and task planning
- Safe and coordinated robot execution
- Sim-to-real transfer capabilities

## Implementation Highlights

- ROS 2-based communication architecture
- NVIDIA Isaac integration for AI processing
- Vision-Language-Action pipeline
- Safety and monitoring systems
- Digital twin simulation for development and testing

## Results

The system successfully demonstrates:
- End-to-end voice-to-action capability
- Real-time perception and decision making
- Coordinated multi-module operation
- Safe operation in dynamic environments

## Future Work

- Enhanced manipulation capabilities
- Advanced reasoning and planning
