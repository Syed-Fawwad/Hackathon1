# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to building autonomous humanoid robots with Physical AI. This project demonstrates the integration of multiple advanced technologies to create a complete robotic system capable of understanding voice commands and executing them in the physical world.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Core communication framework
- Node architecture and communication patterns
- Sensor integration and hardware abstraction

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation environment
- Advanced visualization and debugging
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Perception and computer vision
- Navigation and path planning
- AI inference and cognitive systems

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Voice command processing
- Language understanding and reasoning
- Action generation and execution

## Capstone Integration

The project culminates in a complete autonomous humanoid system that integrates all modules into a working robot capable of responding to voice commands and executing complex behaviors.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the documentation in each module to understand the implementation details and run the examples.
